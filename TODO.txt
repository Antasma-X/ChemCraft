element Moving
borders



rewrite both classes
borders when selected
compound Moving
std::clmap electron pos idea
electron shiifting
bond Creation
cond removal

4. âœ¨ You can now easily add:
Glow/highlight when hovered or selected

Scaling when zooming (via model matrix)

Textured or shaded visuals

Animations (e.g. orbit paths, flashing)


z indexing

Main App:

        "Limestone": "6&12.000000&0&0/8&16.000000&0&0/8&16.000000&0&0/8&16.000000&0&0/20&40.000000&0&0/;1&0)1&0)2&0)3&0)/0&0)0&0)/0&0)4&-1)/0&0)4&-1)/2&1)3&1)/",
        "Limestone",

Now:
glowing button

place where spawns is bad
do eerrors well
            comp=new Compound(atomicNumber);
            Render::createCompoundObject(comp); 
            must go together

gotta fix the fact that valency is fucked
this fact is probably due to the fact the compound string is fuckedfigure it out tom
organuze eveything

Now:
    first redner 
    elements
    electrons
    bonds
    charges


    remeber the dots are there for bonding
    electron shiifting
    valency and element spawning are all fucked
    config stuff and organize
    Write code to minimize bond size


use more referneces
when selected border
                     hovering       
Element Moving
have move function for everything
Compound Moving

error messages
