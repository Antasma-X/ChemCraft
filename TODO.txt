    Assets:
        170 is font for gimp
        2 sets
        one single letter
        one double letter

Future:
    Nomenclature:
        Make nomenclaature a seperate tab that only supports a few elements
        Functional Group Creator

    Problems:
        If the bond fails to create or remove, check success and error
        More Error Checking
        Need to differnetiate datives and electrons better
        Need to Improve Rendering
        c_str 
        error messages
        memory managamenet
        Ionic bond not dotted properly
        Electron is being covered by bond after bond is made. This is basically fixed but it's still a bit glitchy
        Electron, bond, charge not glowing (istg i spent hours trying to figure this out, i gave up)
        Can't form ionic bond nicely
        Can't form dative bond 
        gotta fix the fact that valency is fucked
        this fact is probably due to the fact the compound string is fuckedfigure it out tom

        go back to the beginning and use smart pointers
        go back to the beginning and check everything

        Get rid of all the maps and vectors
        Smart Pointera
        Move semantics
        Copy construcotrs and copy paste
        Enums may be used
        Implement Exceptions
        Understand Stability
        null for bond in group
        fix higher level vlencies
        ionic bonds in acids and salts are a problem
        make a personal lib to use whenevr i need smth subscipt url
        change maps and sets ordered
        somehow protect json code and other code somehow idk
