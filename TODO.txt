Now:

deal with selected eelections too
shifting and dragging electrons
you cant move transparent elecetrons have to enforce

iff bond is failure you gotta check and error push
in callbacks check removebnds success and shit

error checking implement more
we need errors we dative vs electron
updateELement too

figure out rendering
set electron transparent after bondingafter bonding dative should not be selectable


left click not working
 have to figure out removing elements and stuff
 fix shaders
 fix hover
 comments

 fix bonding
 fix rendering



Organization:
run the app
    Comments
    errors
    c_str 
    fix up rendering
    check if everything rendering
    then confirm everything and organize
    error messages
    memory managamenet

    gotta fix the fact that valency is fucked
    this fact is probably due to the fact the compound string is fuckedfigure it out tom
